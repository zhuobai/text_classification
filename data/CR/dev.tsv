overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it	1
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !	1
i 've been incredibly happy with this camera	1
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged	0
is not as intuitive as i would like	0
the only disappointment so far has been battery life	0
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well	1
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions	1
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !	1
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup	0
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it	1
silverfish color really adds a special touch	1
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
cons breaks easily	0
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http www suavest com forum6 html	1
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real life quality	1
it does take some getting used to	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased	1
and so far , i 've been very pleased	1
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating	0
not only is it the perfect size \( not too small , not too large \) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing	1
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m 4m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase	1
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4 5 megapixel	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots	0
\( on here of course \) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones !	0
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !	0
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll push button	1
i then realized a major design flaw	0
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling	0
the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does	1
the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that	0
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package	1
got way too many blurry pictures	0
the more i work with it , the more i love it !	1
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs	1
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it	1
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion	1
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
overall , a good buy for the price	1
2 \) no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones	1
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too	0
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges \( read gross profiteering and price gouging \) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage	0
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker	1
of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless	0
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed	0
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !	1
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders \( on the pc \) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another	0
the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel	0
made the camera totally inoperable	0
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding	1
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down	1
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie ins	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile	0
\( it sure does look nice , though ! \) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !	1
1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism	0
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
decent battery on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock	1
this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start up from 4 down to 2	1
sound exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the vibration is not top	0
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price	1
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs	0
excellent sound quality	1
slow syncro flash , macro infinity mode , etc	1
we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used	0
the blue backlight is pretty cool	1
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !	0
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player	0
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything	1
all in all , not very good	0
bright , visible screen	1
the battery life is amazing	1
1 \) great sound \( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod 's unspecified ratio \) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers	1
the phone is small , light , and very attractive	1
this is a well made and powerful tool	1
the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 bits	0
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !	1
overall , this product is awesome	1
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
the card basically installed itself and the install wizard on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer \( with the 54g card \) and also a second computer in my house \( with an 11b card \)	1
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera	1
the panorama modes are wonderful	1
sure , this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod	1
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies	0
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones	1
the g3 looks like a work of art !	1
it works with a minimum of fuss	1
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i 've sent 10 e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks	0
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres	1
tough as nails	1
the player is great	1
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games	0
the digital zoom is crap	0
also , when i dial an 800 number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu	0
wish i could give it 4 1 2 stars	1
it 's not the heaviest around \( i think porter cable has that distinction \) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation	0
it works great	1
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system	0
it is an extremely cool cozmo	1
the sound quality is excellent \( and i 'm fussy with that stuff \) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod \( besides the price , but everyone knows that \)	1
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made	0
having usb 2 0 makes for very fast transfers	1
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on	1
so , right out of the box i had issue	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
6 \) excellent battery life 14 hours beats ipod 's	1
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it	0
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple	1
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio	1
yes , i recommend it over the competition	1
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front	0
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch \( greer ! \)	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1 250 of a second with third party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere	1
i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot	1
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand new ipod was terribly slow	0
the dvd player just would 't recognize them	0
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium	1
and the battery life is bad !	0
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera	1
the diaper champ is the best !	1
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite	1
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !	1
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark	0
i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great	1
8mb for a camera like this is a joke	0
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal	1
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !	1
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button don 't have a nice click	0
6600 looks and feels nice	1
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this	1
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway	0
2 \) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
1 small	1
well , within 45 days the video output quit working \( both rca optic \)	0
8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth	1
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick	1
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start up	0
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes	1
customer service awful listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier	0
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display	1
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black	1
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution	1
all in all , this is a wonderful device	1
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated	0
great camera	1
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust	0
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard	0
first , it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper	1
gets nice sound too	1
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it \( i encode my songs at 192 256 kbps without variable bit rates \)	0
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off	1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter \?	0
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating	0
1 \) it is perhaps too small	0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway	0
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records	1
i have never had an odor problem !	1
simple and it works !	1
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !	1
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting	1
all the buttons necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily	1
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound	1
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites	0
having the digic ii chip helps a lot	1
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists \) it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray !	1
1 \) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings	1
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer \( pent4 , 256 ram \)	0
2 \) the player user interface \( ui \) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection	1
5 \) the cheap , user replaceable battery \( 50 from creative \) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs 100 to replace	1
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy	1
i was looking for a compact , rugged \( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc \) camera which is easy to use	1
sound quality excellent , everything you would expect from this company	1
accessing files by artist and album \( i mostly look things up by artist \) is easy and intuitive	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops	1
c \) the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
mine installed no problem \( but i did uninstall my norton anti virus 2002 personal firewall 2002 first \)	1
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly	1
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies \( no disc message \)	0
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough	1
like most of their solutions \( which first blame other applications for errors \) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not	0
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual	1
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better	1
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up	1
perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing	1
but it you won 't regret it	1
holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers !	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the fit and finish of the product is first rate	1
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up	0
unfortunately , the touch pad issues non intuitive and poor instruction guide killed it	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i like the speak phone function a lot	1
this camera is great if you 're used to a high end slr	1
after 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds	0
while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch	0
4 \) usb 2 0 means fast data transfers \( 1 song sec ! \)	1
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players	1
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer	0
even the shorter battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way	0
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful easy to use , high quality , and compact in size	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times	0
don 't buy the diaper champ	0
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8	1
and it holds so much music and audio files	1
i love all of the features , and presets as well	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router	1
the movies last about 5 seconds	0
finding a particular song \( s \) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player	0
this camera is bulletproof	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out	0
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly 105 50 per minute and blame you for abusing your ipod	0
durability not good first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months	0
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed	0
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
sound this is where i love zen the most	1
the powershot g3 is a great camera	1
what an upgrade ! ! !	1
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !	0
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock	1
download it fast to your computer	1
decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at 2	1
sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 0 adjust levels function not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though	0
the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad	0
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far	1
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again	1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use	1
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well	1
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it	1
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements	1
all in all , this is another excellent creative product	1
the phone also sports an image gallery \( with option camera attachment \) , a calendar organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio \( way cool , even if it is just through an ear peice \) , games , java applications and gprs high speed internet connection	1
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !	0
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful	0
price , along with the replaceable battery \( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it \) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made	0
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better	1
flawless	1
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion	1
replaceable battery	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it !	1
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle	1
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying	0
9 3x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched !	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
first , it serious , serious installation problems	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this	0
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly	1
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to	0
seems to work great	1
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings	1
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great	1
that is , you can not access the internet at all	0
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications \( chess , currency converter etc \)	1
learning how to use it will not take very long	1
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far \( well over 1000 songs \) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near cd quality	1
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash \( read most reviews on amazon com and see for yourself \)	0
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of	1
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine	1
remote you can stand it on end \( harder to lose \) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s	1
the first one would n 't work from the start	0
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring	0
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did	1
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well	1
only used for 3 month before it 's down !	0
a wise investment for the pocketbook for the nose ! ! !	1
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment \( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight \)	0
the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob	0
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 mbs from my backyard	1
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !	0
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it	0
1 i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users	1
the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
then , my ad pop up blocking was completely gone	0
the touch pad is over sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive	0
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers	1
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems	1
this is extremely lame	0
though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices	0
i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits	0
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots	1
excellent sound i mean the player has juice	1
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc other niceties , that you would enjoy	1
first off , the battery	0
this is ridiculous	0
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together	1
the router works fine for both wired and wireless	1
1 \) the champ is easy to use	1
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i liked this one enough to buy another	1
