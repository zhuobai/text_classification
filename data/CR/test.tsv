i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004	0
all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera	0
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line	1
1 the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !	1
i tried to contact apex to return it \( i missed the amazon return period \) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile	1
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong \?	1
you 'll love it !	1
as a loyal customer of norton symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product \( and hence the one star rating \)	0
i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 \( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 \) , auto white balance \( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well \)	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut	1
they last about 1 1 2 years until the problems start	0
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there	1
b \) the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	0
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable	1
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2 megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design	1
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 \( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red eyes \)	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception	1
however , it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the ad 1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad 1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod	1
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician \( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement \)	1
i love the touchpaper controls	1
you must keep double checking depths	0
3 the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface	1
the touchpad is annoying sometimes \( give me the click wheel and pres sable buttons any day \) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying	0
fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing	1
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers	0
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird	0
one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like	0
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !	1
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed \( mainly the slow processor \) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !	0
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the fm radio is cool	1
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop \( xp operating system \)	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags !	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
4 play n gage games on it	1
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3 4 of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
using supplied s w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it	1
all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype	1
if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you	1
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man \( toy junk \) routers i have previously purchased	1
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi \( my only hitachi tool , by the way \) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder	1
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger	1
the prints are beautiful !	1
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today	0
2 the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space \( well , it is 38 gb in reality \)	1
it 's also easy to empty out	1
the free \( i didnt know they still did that \) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need \( except good headphones \)	1
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it	1
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it	1
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode	1
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect	1
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always	1
battery a big big plus	1
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper	1
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there	1
my experience with installation was quite good	1
t mobile was a pretty good server	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb	0
about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to hip youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the awkward factor	1
love the speaker phone	1
and with usb 2 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that	0
i am glad that i do not work for norton	0
i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit	1
user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website	0
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture	1
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot	1
recently the variable speed control went out	0
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal	1
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks !	1
and it is very easy to clean	1
when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !	0
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough	0
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans	1
battery life is ok	1
it works well enough \( so far \) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something	1
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful scene mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless	1
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it	1
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all \( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife \)	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
so far i have no complaints with this player	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !	0
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires	1
track , name , artist , album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled , and properly categorized into the zen	1
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products	0
hold button suprisingly not all mp3s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket	1
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area \( laos angele 's \) is horrendous	0
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips	0
do n 't buy this player	0
for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome	1
the software that came with it was tough to load	0
2 \) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx \( on the pc \)	1
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd	1
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download	1
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design \( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells \)	0
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd \( and online \) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro	1
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi 8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe \( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card \)	1
it is quiet and has plenty of power	1
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine	0
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all	0
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while	0
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
2 \) phone is awfully slow	0
this one is full of features \( has bluetooth \)	1
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills	1
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight	1
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !	0
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well	0
the sound quality is fantastic \( cd quality \) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills	1
the camera res ponce is very quick	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod	1
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc	1
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly	1
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
the menus are very easy to navigate	1
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry	0
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot	1
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones	0
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table	0
update january 27th 2004 the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product !	0
1 the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer	1
it was \( i sold it after a few months \) too expensive for the shots that i got	0
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open \( the advice to take it slowly is sound \) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !	1
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer	1
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best	0
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff	0
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be	0
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else	1
it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely \( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to \)	0
they didn 't know what the problem could be	0
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast	0
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery	0
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version	0
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all	1
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call	0
this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped	0
the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs	1
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs \( and even more if aac encoding is used \) for the same price \? \? \?	0
the interface works great	1
a little weighty \( 9 ounces no biggie \) , but otherwise fine	0
one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting	1
very small	1
i tried called apex cu st service , no help	0
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings	0
the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds	0
works great !	1
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over \( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back \)	0
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa	0
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet	0
the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally , and make sense	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards	1
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played	0
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !	1
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every day use	0
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days	1
getting the router setup in a vanilla configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem	1
only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash	0
each battery lasts about 10 11 hours	1
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze	0
apex ad 2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw \( unlike sony or panasonic one supports only r rw and another supports r rw \)	1
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the knowledge database at linksys com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own	0
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier	0
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ	1
im a more happier person after discovering the i p button !	1
if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth	0
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is	1
does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library	0
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help	0
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did	1
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !	1
the size is tiny , which i love	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
\( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol \) easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag	1
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing	0
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !	1
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use	1
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders	0
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to	0
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into	1
pros 1 speed 2 signal strength 3 advanced configuration options	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the battery is replaceable \( a real plus \) and there is a leather case \( another real plus \)	1
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable it has a proven track record	1
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display	0
5 \) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn t work either !	0
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security	0
no need for deodorizers	1
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography	1
i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless abra headset	1
it plays alternate video formats \( cads , svcds , cods \) very well	1
styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing	0
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ	1
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
will never purchase apex again	0
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with	1
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality	0
overall this is a slightly better than average phone	1
its compact and has rounded edges	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
it doesn 't stink , ever \( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon \)	1
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless	0
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident	0
incredible memory !	1
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware	0
the flaw is inside the zen	0
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player \( at that size and the price \)	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se !	0
and , other else , the camera is still vga	0
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing	0
in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless	0
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money	1
also , very light and portable	1
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date	1
takes excellent photos	1
1 \) player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
in a word , awesome is how i would describe this camera	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table !	1
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great \( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good \)	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data	0
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !	1
very simple and painless	1
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone	0
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run	0
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it	1
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect	1
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer	1
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application	0
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved	0
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr cadre dvd dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the giff , progressive scan feature	1
third , the poor design continues with the case	0
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich	1
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache	1
it is a very amazing product	1
it works great	1
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router	1
well backlit keypad	1
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera	1
i 've searched the program and their online tech support \( worthless \) and have found no solutions	0
we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third party asking protective covers for an extra thirty bucks	0
the setup software did everything	1
the volume level of the phone is not all that good	0
it is crystal clear	1
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment	0
i mean , they 're short !	0
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name \( and they are long \)	0
when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it	0
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer	0
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems	1
and we definitely prefer our champ !	1
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the height adjustment works well not perfect	1
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people	0
3 the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
3 play java games on it	1
like other reviewers , installation was hell	0
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included	0
i am so pleased with this product ! ! !	1
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk	1
other tagging problems result \( i think \) from the nomad 's operating system	0
1 \) price gb of storage	1
limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod	0
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive	1
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures \( purple fringing , etc \) so i am very pleased	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems	1
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler	1
so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i 've got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that	1
when you look through the viewfinder \( not the lcd \) the bottom left corner of the picture \( about 15 \) is blocked by the lens	0
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
